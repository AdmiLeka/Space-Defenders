A 2D game made in Python. The goal of this game is to shoot enemies and stay near the booster rockets.
The player should also aim to avoid the alien toxic waste, as not to lose points.

Collecting the small spaceship gives you great speed for 5 seconds and allows you to have much greater speed
and access to the ship's rockets.

Reaching 100,000 points and higher transforms your soldier into a super soldier with a super weapon that
passes through the enemies and destroys everything in its path!
